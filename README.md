# Certificate Management System

## Overview

This repository contains the Certificate Management System, a full-stack application for creating, viewing, and managing digital certificates. It features a React-based frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: The React application for the user interface.
- `backend/`: The Node.js/Express API for backend operations.

### Backend (`certificate-management-system`)

- `controllers/`: Contains controllers that handle incoming HTTP requests and sending responses.
- `models/`: Manages data models and interactions with the SQLite database.
- `routes/`: Defines API endpoints and maps them to the controller functions.
- `services/`: Offers services like database interactions, abstracting business logic.
- `tests/`: Contains Jest tests for the controllers to validate the API functionalities.
- `app.js`: Configures the Express application, middleware, and routes.
- `server.js`: Entry point of the application to start the Express server.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables (not committed to source control).
- `swaggerConfig.js`: Swagger configuration for API documentation.

### Frontend (`certificate-management-frontend`)

- `assets/`: Static assets such as images and shared CSS files.
- `components/`: React components for building the user interface, including forms and list views and their css files.
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks, e.g., `useCertificates` for API interactions.
- `types/`: TypeScript definitions and interfaces used throughout the application.
- `App.tsx`: Root React component handling the app's routing.
- `main.tsx`: Entry point that renders the app into the DOM.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git (for version control)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Certificate-Management-System.git


2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**
 cd Certificate-Management-Backend

3. **Install Dependencies**
npm install

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file at the root of the backend directory with the following contents:
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=./path-to-your-database.db

Adjust `DATABASE_URL` to the path where your SQLite database file is located.

5. **Start the Server**
npm start

The server will start and listen on the port specified in the `.env` file.

6. **Access the Backend**
Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser or use a tool like Postman to interact with the API.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**
cd Certificate-Management-Frontend

2. **Install Dependencies**

npm install
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file at the root of the backend directory with the backend URL:

VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

You have put that in useCertificate hook.

. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
npm run dev

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Running Tests

- **Backend Tests**

cd Certificate-Management-Backend
npm test


## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` when the backend server is running.
